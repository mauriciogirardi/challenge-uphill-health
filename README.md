### About Project

Develop a web-based GitHub dashboard to show the most popular GitHub users, the most active GitHub users and their popular repositories.

##### To Do

- [x] I should show the 3 most popular github users - the ones created in the last month and have the most followers.
- [x] I should show each github user's image, id, total followers, and most starred project.
- [x] I Should redirect the user to the user's github page when clicking on **"Open Profile"**·
- [x] Devo mostrar os 3 usuários mais ativos - os criados no mês passado e ter mais repositórios.
- [x] I should show the most starred repositories created in the last year, sorted by total stars.
- [x] I should show the name, description, and total stars for each repository.
- [x] It should be possible to search users and repositories for a specific term.

##### Bonus Task

- [ ] Write a test for the 3 most popular github user resources.
- [x] Deploy the application.
- [x] Instead of redirecting the user to the github.com page, after clicking on "Open profile", it opens a new page with the user's details and his top 3 repositories.
